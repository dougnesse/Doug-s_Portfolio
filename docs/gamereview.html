<h2>Game Review - GTA (1997)</h2>

    <h1>Interactive Map Overview</h1>
  <iframe src="https://embed.kumu.io/1f807f2b86910617c8c691412fcff587" width="940" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <div class="description">
      <p> My Kumu graph models GTA (1997) as four node types- Characters, Objects, Locations, and Missions- each tagged by the game levels where they appear. At the center is the Player Character, linked to objects (Sports Car, Pistol, Machine Gun). NPC nodes like Police (chases) and Gang Members (Attacks) connect back to the player. Mission nodes (Bank Heist, Car Theft, Hit Job) tie together the required objects and target locations (Liberty City, San Andreas, Vice City). By laying out these connections, the map makes it easy to see who does what, where each interaction happens, and how gameplay elements shift as you unlock new cities.</p>

<h1>Visual Design</h1>

    <div class = "description">
      <p> This is GTA 1997s PC launcher menu. You pick between low-color or high-color modes- or the special 3Dfx option if you had that graphics card- before the game starts up. It's a plain start that reminds you it's a mid-'90s title, not build for modern rigs.</p>
    </div>

<div class="description">
<p> The original GTA (1997) has simple, blocky graphics viewed from above, with just a few colors and basic movement. Everything including cars, people, buildings—is easy to see, so you always know what’s happening. The straightforward visuals and clear HUD (mini-map, health bar, wanted stars) keep you focused on driving, shooting, and escaping police without any extra distractions.</p>

<h1>Key Objects & Pick‑ups</h1>

    <alt= GTA (1997)><figcaption style="text-align:center"> GTA (1997) Pick-ups (When your character goes over the arrows, a mission commences).</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="description">
  <p>   Every object you touch serves a clear purpose. You hijack vehicles, everything from sports cars and taxis to ambulances and even tanks to move around the city or make a quick getaway. Weapons like pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers are found on the street or in gun shops, and you grab them along with ammunition to defend yourself and complete missions.  Icons on the street restore your health, add body armor, or drop cash when you drive over them. You are also prompted to go to destinations by following an arrow on the screen. Finally, certain missions are called upon when going to phone-booths and require you to pick up special items like, briefcases full of money, bombs, or other cargo, and deliver them to specific locations. There’s no reading notes or eating food. Every object you find directly helps you survive, fight, or escape. </p>

<h1>Sound & Music</h1>
<div class="description">
  <p>   The sounds in GTA (1997) are all about clear feedback and mood. There are engine noises when you start a car, tires screech in turns, and police sirens scream as your wanted level rises. Each cue instantly tells you what’s happening. Gunshots and explosions are sharp and distinct, so you know when you hit a target or cause destruction. Scattered “beep” pickups confirm you’ve collected health, armor, or cash. Between missions, simple looped music plays on the in-game radio, setting vibes without getting in the way. Every sound serves a gameplay function whether alerting you to danger, confirming actions, or simply just enhancing the city’s atmosphere.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <p> Left (Liberty City): The original downtown area, Level-1, with dense streets, industrial zones, and bridges connecting islands. </p>

    <p> Right (San Andreas): The Level-2 city unlocked next, with more open grids, residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, and a waterfront marina. Each district’s color highlights its distinct street layout and land use.</p>

    <p> You can roam freely anywhere within each unlocked district and there are no barriers except the map edge. Liberty City feels tight and industrial with narrow streets, warehouses, and bridges. San Andreas opens introduces wider roads, residential blocks, and a waterfront marina. Vice City (Not Shown - Level-3) adds coastal roads, docks, and beachside landmarks. Each area stands out through its differentiating street patterns, building types, and ambient details.</p>

  <h1> Gameplay </h1>

</figure>

<div class="description">
  <p>   In this game, you control a single anonymous criminal throughout the entire storyline. There is no character switching or party, you are always this one criminal whose only identity comes from the missions you accept and the chaos you cause. You learn who this character is not from back stories or cut-scenes but from the way the game presents your objectives (steal this car, or assassinate this target) and from the rising wanted stars that increase as you complete these missions. </p>

  <p>   Because there is only one playable character, all of your interactions are based on that characters actions: you hijack vehicles, open fire on gangs, escape police chases, and collect items that help you like health and armour. NPCs react in simple but self explanatory ways, they scatter when you are carrying a weapon, or ram your car into them or a crowd, gang members attack you on sight when you are on their territory and police escalates from sirens into tanks as your wanted levels rise. These reactions give you a clear sense of who you are in the world, which is the public enemy #1. How each NPC type reacts represents the type of character they are, making that controllable character feel vivid even without a name or voice. </p>

<div class="description">
  <p>In this game, you are tested by a steady ramp-up of objectives and by the cities. Early on, you're told to steal cars, or lose the police, which feels easy on the open and quiet streets. But as you progress and your wanted stars rise, police make roadblocks, call in tanks, and suddenly, you're getaway route is cutoff forcing you to improvise. You get stuck when your usual shortcuts are cutoff or you can't find the correct vehicle for the mission. To move forward, you learn the street patterns, stock up on armour and weapons at safe spots, and try different cars for different types of objectives. Each failure you make you learn something from, you learn new tricks, timing your turns, using narrow lanes, or swapping to a tougher ride. So in this game, progress is made by adjusting your playstyle to missions, mastering the maps, and by your own play style.</p>

  <p>The original GTA almost never shows you it's "just a game." The only hint of self awareness is the boot-up screen shown at the top of the page, where it offers different versions, showing you that it is just a game. Otherwise, the world stays locked in, police sirens, missions, and radio communications all treat the crime spree as "real." </p>

  <p>   It doesn't tackle real-world politics or social issues, it simply shows the 1990s obessions with fast cars, crime dramas, and cop-and-robber fantasies. The flashing wanted stars and relentless police chases mirror TV shows and the action movies of this era. The game doesn't lecture, it just hands you the chaos and challenges you to survive it.</p>

<p>   Looking ahead, Rockstar Games TM has already produced eight Grand Theft Auto games, with the one we've reviewed being the first. We are now looking at the future of gaming with GTA VI. Up to this point, they have 435 million units sold with 205 million of them being from GTA V. They have an impressive track record, with the new GTA VI predicted to be the golden standard of video games. This new game will feel alive, not just larger. Shops open and close on schedule, traffic peaks at rush hour, and weather affects driving and combat. The playable characters in this game have voices, back-stories, and relationships which all heavily impact the characters personality. There will be dialogue, side-missions which will create waves throughout the cities. Random events are more prone, which include: mugging in alley ways, or street races. You'll be able to climb skyscrapers, hide in building, rooftops, and flee through underground tunnels as smart AI characters give relentless pursuits. There will be an interactive economy- cars, property, and even a stock market, which will react to your heists and investments. Seamless co-op lets your friends join you for bank heists and even nightclubs. Collectively, everyone's actions will reshape the shared world. GTA VI won't just be a bigger playground, but a dynamic and changing city that remembers the actions you take.
