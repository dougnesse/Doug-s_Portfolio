<h1>Reflection on Two Different Approaches to Website Development</h1>
<div class="model-container">
 <div class="description">
<p>Developing websites using both HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on GitHub Pages and WordPress offered a unique perspective on the strengths and challenges of each approach. While both platforms allowed me to create functional websites with the same information, the development experience was very different. In this reflection, I will discuss the challenges, advantages, and skills required for each method, as well as the skills I wish to improve in the future.</p>

<h1>Challenges for New Learners</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>For a new learner, the most significant challenge with GitHub Pages is understanding how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git commands effectively. The need to manually write and edit code without a graphical interface can be stressful without knowing much about web development. In contrast, WordPress makes the process significantly easier and straightforward with its drag-and-drop and pre-built themes, making it easier for beginners. However, mastering WordPress plugins and customization options can still be difficult. I believe that you can do more with the HTML approach in the means of customizing when you fully understand the process. </p>

<h1>Advantages of Each Method</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>One of the primary advantages of using coding is the control it offers. This approach allows for complete customization of the site's layout, design, and functionality without limitations by themes like WordPress. It also supports fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the other hand, WordPress’s advantage is its efficiency and ease of use for all skill levels. Its library of plugins and themes improves the development process, allowing a fully functional website to be created quickly without coding knowledge.</p>

<h1>Challenges in Modifying Layout and Organization</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>Customizing the layout by coding can be challenging due to the need for doing everything manually, including responsive design and browser compatibility. Making large changes often requires an in-depth understanding of CSS and layouts. Meanwhile, WordPress offers an easier approach to layout adjustment through its theme customizer and page builders. However, the downside is that certain customizations are limited by the chosen theme’s capabilities unless additional plugins or custom CSS is added.</p>

<h1>Necessary Skills for Each Platform</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>To develop a site on GitHub Pages, proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic Git commands is essential. Understanding how to create and manage repositories, commit changes, and updates is also crucial. For WordPress, skills in content management, plugin management, and basic knowledge of CSS for theme customization are important. Familiarity with SEO plugins and optimization techniques can also significantly enhance a WordPress site’s performance.</p>

<h1>Skills I Want to Improve</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>Moving forward, I aim to gain deeper understanding of JavaScript to enhance the interactivity of my coded site. I love the aspect of JavaScript and everything you can do with it. </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<div class="description">
<p>In conclusion, both coding and WordPress have their own advantages and challenges. Coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is ideal for those who want full control over their code and are willing to invest time in learning web development. WordPress, meanwhile, provides a faster and more user-friendly way to build websites with professional designs. Mastering both platforms not only expands my skill set but also allows me to choose the most suitable tool for future projects based on the requirements and time constraints.</p>
