<h2>Autobiography</h2> 
<div class="p"><p>Hi, my name is Doug Nesselhauf, and I’m currently in my junior year here at Behrend. I am dual majoring in Management Information Systems and Project and Supply Chain Management. My goal for college is to find a company that is good to me and where I have room to grow. I am a motivated, goal-oriented, well-rounded individual who gets along with others, learns quickly, and prioritizes multiple tasks. I am currently involved in several organizations that promote community involvement and student wellness, causes I am passionate about. </p></div>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<div class="p"><p>I find immense joy and fulfillment in spending time with my family and friends in my free time. Whether hanging out at home, going out for food, or a day of adventure, these moments create memories I will always hold close to me. 
One of my favorite things to do is play sports, not only to stay active but also to build bonds with people who share their passion for sports. 
My next hobby is riding my dirtbike, snowmobile, and four-wheelers. As my parents have a good majority of property, I always find myself in the woods on some type of machine. 
When I’m indoors, I enjoy playing video games like Call of Duty, Minecraft, Rocket League and MX vs. ATV Reflex. Regarding TV, I enjoy watching cartoons like Family Guy, Simpsons, and South Park. Also, I religiously follow the NFL, watching live games at every opportunity.
