        <h3>Football Explaination</h3>
        <p>American football is a team sport where two teams of 11 players each aim to score points
            by advancing an oval-shaped football into the opposing team's end zone. Teams can move
            the ball by running with it or passing it. The game is played on a 100-yard field with
            goalposts at each end. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.This
            bulleted list contains some American football terms.</p>
