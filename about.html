        <p>The Tesla Final Case Report is an in-depth analysis of how Project Portfolio Management (PPM - MGMT 415) can be implemented at Tesla Inc. to streamline decision-making, optimize resources, and align projects with the company’s strategic goals. This report is mostly fictional but explores Tesla's mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and how a well-structured PPM framework can support this vision. It covers various aspects of PPM, including strategic alignment, risk management, and portfolio balancing, to ensure that projects not only drive innovation but also contribute to long-term organizational success. I took this course in the Fall semester of my senior year.</p>
