        <div class="content">
            <p>Hi, my name is Doug Nesselhauf, and I’m currently in my junior year here at Behrend. I am dual majoring in Management Information Systems and Project and Supply Chain Management. My goal for college is to find a company that is good to me and where I have room to grow. I am a motivated, goal-oriented, well-rounded individual who gets along with others, learns quickly, and prioritizes multiple tasks. I am currently involved in several organizations that promote community involvement and student wellness, causes I am passionate about.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I find immense joy and fulfillment in spending time with my family and friends in my free time. Whether hanging out at home, going out for food, or a day of adventure, these moments create memories I will always hold close to me.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite things to do is play sports, not only to stay active but also to build bonds with people who share their passion for sports.</p>
            <p>My next hobby is riding my dirtbike, snowmobile, and four-wheelers. As my parents have a good majority of property, I always find myself in the woods on some type of machine.</p>
            <p>When I’m indoors, I enjoy playing video games like Call of Duty, Minecraft, and MX vs. ATV Reflex. Regarding TV, I enjoy watching cartoons like Family Guy, The Simpsons, and South Park. Also, I religiously follow the NFL, watching live games at every opportunity.</p>
