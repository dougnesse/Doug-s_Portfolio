<div class="description">
  <p> The original GTA (1997) has simple, blocky graphics viewed from above, with just a few colors and basic movement. Everything including cars, people, buildings—is easy to see, so you always know what’s happening. The straightforward visuals and clear HUD (mini-map, health bar, wanted stars) keep you focused on driving, shooting, and escaping police without any extra distractions.</p>

  <p> Every object you touch serves a clear purpose. You hijack vehicles, everything from sports cars and taxis to ambulances and even tanks to move around the city or make a quick getaway. Weapons like pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers are found on the street or in gun shops, and you grab them along with ammunition to defend yourself and complete missions.  Icons on the street restore your health, add body armor, or drop cash when you drive over them. You are also prompted to go to destinations by following an arrow on the screen. Finally, certain missions are called upon when going to phone-booths and require you to pick up special items like, briefcases full of money, bombs, or other cargo, and deliver them to specific locations. There’s no reading notes or eating food. Every object you find directly helps you survive, fight, or escape. </p>

  <p> The sounds in GTA (1997) are all about clear feedback and mood. There are engine noises when you start a car, tires screech in turns, and police sirens scream as your wanted level rises. Each cue instantly tells you what’s happening. Gunshots and explosions are sharp and distinct, so you know when you hit a target or cause destruction. Scattered “beep” pickups confirm you’ve collected health, armor, or cash. Between missions, simple looped music plays on the in-game radio, setting vibes without getting in the way. Every sound serves a gameplay function whether alerting you to danger, confirming actions, or simply just enhancing the city’s atmosphere.</p>

<div class="description">
  <p> Left (Liberty City): The original downtown area, Level-1, with dense streets, industrial zones, and bridges connecting islands. </p>

  <p> Right (San Andreas): The Level-2 city unlocked next, with more open grids, residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, and a waterfront marina. Each district’s color highlights its distinct street layout and land use.</p>

  <p>You can roam freely anywhere within each unlocked district and there are no barriers except the map edge. Liberty City feels tight and industrial with narrow streets, warehouses, and bridges. San Andreas opens introduces wider roads, residential blocks, and a waterfront marina. Vice City (Not Shown - Level-3) adds coastal roads, docks, and beachside landmarks. Each area stands out through its differentiating street patterns, building types, and ambient details.</p>
